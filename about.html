            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'am a student at ESQ
                Business School majoring in Computer Science. I
                have an interest in programming, creativity, design graphic, video
                editing, and typography. I like to learn new and challenging
                things.</p>

            <h2>Why make this website?</h2>
            <p>I made this website to learn what actually goes into web development. 
                From planning, design, development, launch, and maintenance. 
                For sure there are other things that I have yet to encounter, 
                and I'm ready to learn them. This also serves a motivation for me to continue making projects 
                because now I finally have a place to showcase them.</p>
